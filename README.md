# Text-Classification-with-Tensorflow 
This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation for text classification using various deep learning models. 
Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to assign predefined categories or labels to textual data.

# Overview
Text classification is a crucial component in many applications, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic categorization, and more. 
In this project, we leverage the power of TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework, to build and train deep learning models for text classification tasks.

# Features
Implementation of several deep learning architectures for text classification, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformer-based models.
Support for various datasets commonly used in text classification tasks.
Preprocessing pipelines for cleaning and tokenizing textual data.
Evaluation metrics and tools for model performance assessment.
Jupyter and Google colab notebooks demonstrating how to use and adapt the models for specific text classification tasks.
